GUI Calculator Using Python Tkinter
📌 Project Overview

This project is a desktop-based GUI calculator developed using Python and the Tkinter library. It performs basic arithmetic operations through an interactive graphical interface and demonstrates core concepts of GUI programming and event-driven design.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3

GUI Library: Tkinter

IDE: Any Python-supported IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE)

✨ Features

Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /

Dynamic button generation

Clear (C) and Backspace (<) functionality

Error handling for invalid expressions

Fixed-size, user-friendly interface

▶️ How to Run the Project

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system

Open a terminal or command prompt

Navigate to the project directory

Run the following command:

python calculator.py


The calculator window will open

⚙️ How It Works

User inputs numbers and operators using buttons

Input is displayed in the entry widget

Pressing = evaluates the expression

Results or error messages are displayed instantly

🚫 Limitations

Uses Python’s eval() function (not safe for complex inputs)

Supports only basic arithmetic operations

No keyboard input support

🚀 Future Enhancements

Replace eval() with a safer expression parser

Add scientific calculator functions

Enable keyboard input

Improve UI with themes and layouts

📄 Conclusion

This project serves as a foundational example of GUI application development using Python Tkinter. It is suitable for academic purposes and can be extended into more advanced calculator applications.
